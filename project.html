  <h2>-- 1] pulse ride : A smart wheel chair</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Individuals with mobility impairments often rely on wheelchairs for daily movement; however, conventional wheelchairs lack essential safety, health monitoring, and navigation support.
        Caregivers are unable to continuously monitor the user’s health condition, location, or surrounding environment, which can lead to delayed medical assistance during emergencies.
        Additionally, obstacles, uneven paths, and poor navigation assistance increase the risk of accidents and reduce the independence of differently-abled individuals. 
        There is a need for an intelligent, assistive wheelchair system that integrates health monitoring, obstacle 
        detection, and real-time location tracking to enhance safety, autonomy, and quality of life.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>-- 2] AI-Enabled Crowd Control System</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Overcrowding in public spaces such as events, transportation hubs, and religious gatherings poses a serious risk to public safety, often leading to panic situations, stampedes, and injuries. 
        Traditional crowd management methods rely heavily on manual supervision or camera-based monitoring, which can be ineffective in low-visibility conditions, high-density environments, or resource-limited areas. 
        Furthermore, the lack of real-time, data-driven alerts prevents authorities from responding promptly to crowd congestion and abnormal movement patterns. 
        There is a critical need for an intelligent crowd monitoring system that can detect crowd density variations in real time and provide early alerts to prevent accidents and ensure public safety.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>-- 3] Mindguard</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>IMental stress, fatigue, and neurological health issues are increasingly common due to modern lifestyle patterns; however, early detection and continuous monitoring of brain health remain limited. 
        Conventional diagnostic methods are often expensive, non-continuous, and require clinical environments, making them unsuitable for regular monitoring. 
        Individuals lack access to affordable systems that can provide real-time insights into brain activity, stress levels, and physiological conditions. 
        The absence of continuous brain health monitoring can lead to delayed identification of mental health concerns and reduced preventive care. 
        Therefore, there is a need for an intelligent, non-invasive system that enables real-time monitoring of brain health parameters to support early awareness, preventive analysis, and improved well-being.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>-- 4] DL Authentication</h2>
  <ul>
    </li>Road transport authorities still rely on manual license verification, which is slow, forge-prone, and impossible to enforce at scale during real-time vehicle operation.
         Unlicensed or expired-license drivers continue to operate vehicles because there is no embedded authentication layer that prevents engine ignition based on license validity and identity matching. 
         Existing solutions like biometric or centralized cloud verification were proposed but remain impractical for offline enforcement, leading to poor traceability of license expiry for RTO/RTO systems. 
         This project attempts a digital license check using RFID with signature and CRC validation, but the fundamental problem remains: there is no on-vehicle mechanism that automatically 
         validates a driver’s identity and license status and blocks vehicle start when authorization fails, resulting in continued safety risks and regulatory violations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>-- 5] AI Powered Battlefield Scent Detector </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The detection of chemical warfare agents on battlefields remains unreliable because traditional gas detection units are slow, lack intelligent classification, 
        and generate high false alarm rates in environments containing mixed benign and toxic gases, smoke, humidity variation, and industrial chemical contamination. 
        There is no portable edge-deployed system that continuously interprets multi-sensor chemical signatures in real time with embedded AI to accurately distinguish 
        lethal agents such as nerve gases or sulfur-based toxic compounds from non-threat gases, while also providing instant localized alerts to troops and 
        remote command units without requiring constant cloud dependence. This creates a critical capability gap in early warning, increasing chemical exposure risk, 
        delayed response, mission disruption, and preventable casualties.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>-- 6] BLE ID-card–based Attendance System. </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The conventional attendance and personnel-presence tracking methods used in classrooms and workplaces—such as manual roll-calls, RFID tap systems, 
        and basic Bluetooth-based automation—are prone to proxy attendance, limited range, physical interaction overhead, and poor scalability. 
        BLE tags offer a low-power, contactless alternative, but many student implementations fail due to incorrect hardware selection, absence of continuous presence validation, 
        unreliable proximity filtering, and lack of integration with embedded scanning nodes like the ESP32. The problem is the need for a cost-effective, wireless, non-connectable 
        BLE-advertising badge system that looks like a normal ID card, broadcasts a fixed unique identifier, and can be reliably sensed by a passive scanner to confirm true physical 
        presence within a defined zone and time window, while avoiding high hardware cost and system misuse.</li>
